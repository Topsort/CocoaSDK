**sessionId** | **String** | Long-lived token identifying the customer interacting with the marketplace. If your users are always logged in you may use a hash of your customer ID. If your users may interact with your app or site while logged out we recommend generating a random identifier (UUIDv4) on first load and store it on local storage (cookie, local storage, etc) and let it live for at least a year.  |
